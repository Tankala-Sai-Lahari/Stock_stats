# Stock_stats
Pandas practice
load stock data into a Pandas Dataframe and calculate some statistics on it

We can also visualize the rolling mean by plotting the data in our dataframe. In the following lessons you will learn how to use Matplotlib to visualize data. For now I will just import matplotlib and plot the Google stock data on top of the rolling mean. You can play around by changing the rolling mean window and see how the plot changes.
